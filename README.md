 <li>(General probability)</li>

</ol>

Consider two events A and B such that 0 &lt; P(B) &lt; 1. For each of the following statements, decide whether they are always true for any such A and B, always false or could be either.

<ol>

 <li>P(A ∪ B) ≥ P(A) + P(B)</li>

 <li>P(A|B) ⋅ P(A) = P(A ∩ B)</li>

 <li>P(A ∪ B|B) ≥ P(A|B)</li>

 <li>P(A ∩ B|B) + P(A ∩ B<sup>c </sup>|B) = 1</li>

 <li>P(A|B) + P(A<sup>c </sup>|B) &lt; 1</li>

 <li>A⊥B ⇒ P(A|B) = P(A|Bc)</li>

 <li>A⊥B ⇒ P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</li>

There are three cards in a hat. One card is red on both sides, one card is blue on both sides, and one card is red on one side and blue on the other. You draw one card at random, put it down on the table and then observe that the side of the card facing up is red. What is the probability that the other side is red too?
